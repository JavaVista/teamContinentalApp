# NASA’s International Space Apps Challenge App

## Chanllenge -  SMASH YOUR SDGS!

Your challenge is to develop creative solutions that use Earth observations to address the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals and foster sustainable development worldwide. Use NASA and other Earth observing satellites’ data as well as information generated by crowd-sourcing and in-situ measurements to create practical applications that support environmental and societal policy across water, health, food security and/or land use domains.

## Solution - PORT CITY IMPACTS

Effects of long-term sea level rise on port cities 90% of world merchandise trade travels by sea, and port cities are essential to the global economy. World sea levels are projected to rise by 2 to 70 meters over the next several decades. Our team aims to show the impacts to selected port cities by 30 meters of sea level rise.
